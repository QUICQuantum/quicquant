      "thumbnailDesc": "It's been more than two decades since quantum computing was first developed, but Wall Street has started to warm up to the technology's long-term prospects. Several pure-play stocks went public in 2021 when investor sentiment was sky-high.Quantum computing technology harnesses the power of quantum mechanics, utilizing effects like superposition -- the phenomenon that occurs at the subatomic scale in which objects have no clearly defined state. It's exciting because this field of research promises to accelerate computing speed by an order of magnitude greater than what's possible today. Image source: Getty Images. However, while quantum computing has made great strides in just a few years, the technology is still mostly in the research and development stage in 2025. Quantum computers are continually improving and becoming more affordable to develop, and the advent of cloud computing is making quantum technology even more accessible for researchers and software developers.For example, in December 2024, researchers at the Google Quantum AI group demonstrated a new quantum computing chip called Willow. This chip had the strongest error correction seen to that point and performed extremely well in industry-standard benchmark tests such as the random circuit sampling (RCS) test.The achievement inspired a quick boom in quantum computing stocks. However, the researchers also made it clear that Willow's performance was just a small step on a long road.Computing power needs are ballooning as the digital economy and artificial intelligence (AI) expand. Spending on global cloud computing alone is predicted to rise to $1 trillion annually within the next decade. Quantum computing could emerge as a key technology by the end of the 2020s as its viability for cloud and AI tasks continues to develop rapidly.However, that's an extremely optimistic timeline. Many experts would rather point to the mid-2040s as the start date for truly game-changing quantum computers. Best stocksBest quantum computing stocks in 2025There are few quantum computing pure-play companies. Some very tiny, high-risk businesses, like D-Wave Quantum (QBTS -6.61%) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI 4.03%), went public early in the pandemic but are now approaching penny stock status.A number of companies creating software for quantum computers also exist, such as security software start-up Arqit Quantum (ARQQ -3.25%) and integrated hardware and software company Quantum Computing (QUBT -7.76%). A quantum computing exchange-traded fund (ETF) is available as well to get more general exposure to this nascent industry.Nevertheless, many larger tech businesses and semiconductor designers are increasing their activity in the quantum realm. Here are some top companies with a hand in the actual development of quantum computers: Data source: YCharts. Data current as of market close on Feb. 14, 2025. Company Market Capitalization Description IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) $8.1 billion The first pure-play publicly traded quantum computing stock had its initial public offering (IPO) via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger earlier this year. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) $3.0 trillion The software giant has a hand in all things technology, including labs dedicated to developing quantum computers. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) $2.2 trillion The parent company of Google has a growing cloud computing segment and a dedicated quantum computing research team. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) $3.4 trillion This is an emerging leader in semiconductor design and software for next-gen computing development, including quantum computing applications. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) $102 billion The historic leader in the semiconductor industry is currently investing heavily to regain its former dominance, with significant efforts in quantum computing. Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) $132 billion This industrial conglomerate developed its own quantum computer. Its Quantinuum subsidiary had an estimated market value of $5 billion in January 2024 and $20 billion before the end of the same year. IBM (NYSE:IBM) $242 billion The legacy tech giant is now refocused on cloud computing needs, including a quantum computing segment. FormFactor (NASDAQ:FORM) $4.4 billion The semiconductor equipment company makes cooling and testing systems for quantum computers. 1. IonQIonQ went public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) dMY Technology Group III in 2021. IonQ is a start-up-stage quantum computing company and the first quantum computing pure-play (i.e., all it does is quantum computing development) to become publicly traded. IonQ develops quantum computing hardware and is the first to have its computing systems available via all the major public cloud services. It plans to build a network of quantum computers accessible via the cloud and is targeting rapid growth in 2025 as researchers begin using its hardware at a greater scale.IonQ's orientation toward cloud computing is illustrated by its partnerships with Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN -3.68%) Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud. Japanese telecommunications company and tech investor SoftBank Group (SFTBF -3.46%) has also invested in IonQ.SoftBank is partnering with IonQ to bring quantum computing power to the many other tech companies in its portfolio. IonQ's most powerful computer, Aria, has been available since May 2023 via an AWS service.IonQ generates little in the way of revenue so far and is not yet profitable. It will need to continue spending heavily to develop its products and business for at least a few more years.Investing in this start-up is a speculative play. If IonQ's research efforts are successful, the stock could be a profitable way to invest in quantum computing, but investors should act with prudence. This is still a start-up business, and its valuation is often sky-high.2. Microsoft The software titan researches and develops all sorts of technology, and quantum computing technology is no exception. Quantum computers need special refrigeration, hardware designed at microscopic levels, and special software, all of which Microsoft is developing in its labs. Microsoft also offers researchers access to quantum computing services via its massive cloud platform, Azure.Quantum computing tech probably won't be a significant driver of Microsoft's financial performance anytime soon. However, the company is helping to develop the next generation of computing technology. Microsoft stock has been a winning investment for decades, and its importance in the software technology field will persist for a very long time.3. Alphabet Alphabet subsidiary Google, the third-largest public cloud computing platform, has developed its own quantum computing chips, branded Sycamore. The tech behemoth is using quantum computing to advance its AI software systems. In March 2022, it spun off its quantum computing software unit into an independent start-up called SandboxAQ.Google's interest in better, faster, and smarter methods of computing stems from its leading role in internet search. The company is responsible for organizing massive amounts of digital data, and it can profit significantly by helping all types of organizations leverage the power of that information.Quantum computing coupled with AI may provide a way for Google to improve the efficiency of large computing systems. This technology is central to the company's efforts to innovate.4. Nvidia Nvidia has emerged as the global leader in advanced semiconductor designs, powering next-gen tech with its graphics processing units (GPUs) that accelerate computing power. Nvidia is helping to develop quantum computers using its GPUs, retaining its leadership role in developing sophisticated circuitry design. The company is also a leader in AI and machine learning. Nvidia is leveraging its software developed for GPUs to support the development of quantum computing. It has released cuQuantum, a software development kit designed to help software developers build workflows on quantum computing.On the hardware side, Nvidia announced DGX Quantum in early 2023. This system pairs Nvidia's most advanced GPUs with quantum hardware developed by start-up Quantum Machines. It is made for researchers advancing quantum computing technology. Nvidia's quantum work has wide-ranging uses, from breakthroughs in jet engine efficiency to rapid drug and healthcare development.5. Intel Intel lost its lead in the semiconductor industry. Third-party foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -4.58%) passed Intel up a few years ago, and numerous companies (including Nvidia) are valued far higher owing to their greater exposure to growth markets like GPUs for AI.But Intel is mounting a comeback. One of its initiatives includes a quantum computing chip called Tunnel Falls. The silicon-based chip uses Intel's most advanced manufacturing processes and is now available to the research community. Intel says it has partnered with numerous government and university research departments to test Tunnel Falls.Quantum computing is not central to Intel's plan to regain its dominance in the semiconductor industry. Still, if research yields positive results, it could become an important segment for the integrated chip design and manufacturing giant later on. 6. Honeywell Honeywell is best known as an industrial manufacturer that produces everything from aerospace equipment to advanced construction materials to medical devices. However, Honeywell is also a technology firm whose diverse work includes quantum computing.Honeywell built its own quantum computer unit, which it spun off as a separate business and merged with start-up Cambridge Quantum Computing in January 2024. The new stand-alone entity is called Quantinuum (which is now on its second-gen quantum computer).Honeywell remains a majority shareholder with a 54% ownership stake. It also supplies Quantinuum with hardware and software as it develops its quantum computing technology. Quantinuum has been particularly focused on developing new cybersecurity services and chemistry.7. IBM IBM is a legacy technology firm that is refocusing on cloud computing opportunities. It also has its own quantum computing chips and systems available for commercial use via the company's IBM Quantum business unit. More than 210 research organizations and companies, ranging from financial services businesses to automakers to energy producers, use IBM's quantum computing services.In 2021, the company struck a deal with government contractor Raytheon Technologies (RTX -1.05%) to develop AI and quantum computing for the aerospace, defense, and intelligence industries. The U.S. government will be a top customer of the research collaboration. IBM combines an innovative product portfolio with modest stock gains compared to other quantum computing and AI experts.8. FormFactor FormFactor is a small company that makes semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Its specialty is probe cards, which test silicon wafers and chips for defects. However, it also has a \"Systems\" business unit, which houses its cryogenic systems -- a key ingredient in building quantum computers and testing chips at the quantum level.The company's financial results will be primarily tied to the semiconductor manufacturing industry. However, for investors looking for a way to bet early on the development of quantum computing, FormFactor's stock is worth keeping an eye on. If quantum computing eventually takes off, its cryogenic systems could be a big beneficiary.Related investing topics Investing in Quantum Glass Battery Stocks Batteries are essential for the energy transition.

The problem is that it's impossible to know at this point which of these will ultimately be the most successful.For aggressive investors willing to tolerate significant volatility and risk, perhaps the best strategy is to buy shares of each of them and wait. Keep in mind, though, that none of these stocks may deliver positive gains over the long term, much less be millionaire makers.Among the established players, Alphabet appears to be the best bet to make $1 million over time. Sure, the company faces some risks -- notably including regulatory challenges. But I fully expect Alphabet's Google unit to continue dominating search for a long time to come.I look for Google Cloud to keep growing rapidly. Waymo has a huge opportunity in the robotaxi market. And maybe, just maybe, Google will achieve its goal of building \"a useful, error-corrected quantum computer\" by the end of the decade.",

      "thumbnailDesc": "Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) have powered massive returns for investors who bought into the biggest beneficiaries early. AI spending has propelled the entire stock market higher as investors expect it to unlock a ton of economic value. But the biggest winners of the current trend in artificial intelligence so far have been chipmakers like Nvidia.The next big breakthrough in technology could be quantum computing. Quantum chips use the principles of quantum mechanics to process information and solve certain types of problems at much faster speeds than a traditional computer.There are several publicly traded companies working to develop quantum chips. The challenge many face is scaling their designs to the point where they can solve real-world problems without producing so many errors along the way that their calculations completely fall apart. While many expect quantum chips to eventually help provide breakthroughs in drug development, cybersecurity, and machine learning, many believe the technology is still years, if not decades, away from that point.That's why if I'm going to invest in a single quantum computing stock, it should be one that I know will still be around 10 or 20 years from now.Image source: Getty Images.The quantum computing stock with the most staying powerMost of the pure-play quantum computing companies have very little revenue without broadly applicable commercial products to sell to customers.IonQ (IONQ -9.50%) is the biggest of the pure plays with a market cap of around $6.9 billion as of this writing and it generated all of $37.5 million over the last 12 months. That stems from researchers studying quantum systems using its technology. Smaller companies Quantum Computing (QUBT -7.76%) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI 4.03%) had revenue of just $386,000 and $11.9 million, respectively, over the last 12 months.Without significant sources of revenue, all three are burning significant amounts of cash developing their technology. IonQ's operations resulted in a cash burn of $92.9 million over the trailing 12 months. Rigetti burned $54.5 million and Quantum Computing dropped $17.4 million in cash on its operations.That puts them in precarious positions, where they need to raise cash to continue their research. But a failure to show results jeopardizes their ability to raise cash. One disappointing development and they could find themselves closer to the end of their cash runways than expected.So, a company that can self-fund its quantum computing research and development is a much safer bet. On top of that, if a bigger business does develop an advanced quantum chip, it already has the resources to scale production. What's more, a company with additional business ventures outside of quantum computing likely has multiple ways to monetize quantum chips outside of selling them to cloud platforms to rent out to researchers and developers.That's why the quantum computing stock that I'd prefer to own above all others is Alphabet (GOOG -0.45%) (GOOGL -0.39%). It certainly doesn't have the upside potential of the smaller pure-play stocks to increase in value, but it's most likely to be able to spend the money necessary to advance its research to the point where it develops a useful quantum chip.

Three months ago, only IonQ could make that claim. Market values ranged from $107 million for Quantum Computing to $253 million for Rigetti three months ago.</p><p>Are these hungry upstarts too hot to touch, or are they simply great investments after January's price correction?</p><h2>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's reality check</h2><p>The recent price drops stemmed <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/01/09/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-just-delivered-terrible-ne/\">an important statement</a> from <strong>Nvidia</strong> <span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"204770\">(<a class=\"ticker-symbol\" href=\"/quote/nasdaq/nvda/\">NVDA</a><span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -5.74%</span>)</span> CEO Jensen Huang.</p><p>Under the main-stage lights of the CES technology conference, Huang said that quantum computers are a long way away from being useful in any real-world application.</p><p>\"If you kind of said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,\" Huang said. \"If you said 30, it's probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.\"</p><div data-pitch-placement=\"in_line_article_pitch\"></div><p>That calm observation doused the hot gains of quantum computing stocks like a bucket of ice-cold water. Based on a recent technology breakthrough by <strong>Alphabet</strong>'s <span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"288965\">(<a class=\"ticker-symbol\" href=\"/quote/nasdaq/goog/\">GOOG</a><span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.45%</span>)</span> <span class=\"font-bold whitespace-nowrap\" data-id=\"203768\">(<a class=\"ticker-symbol\" href=\"/quote/nasdaq/googl/\">GOOGL</a><span class=\"text-red-900 ticker-change\"> -0.39%</span>)</span> Google Quantum AI group, many investors expected quantum computing to become a useful technology very soon. Stretching that timeline from a couple of years to a couple of decades isn't quite as rewarding in the short term.</p><h2>The struggle is real and the road is long</h2><p>With Huang's note in mind, you can't expect companies like IonQ or D-Wave to become cash-gushing industry giants anytime soon. Instead, the companies must find a way to develop money-making systems and services before running out of cash. That won't be easy in most cases.</p><p>Sector leader IonQ saw third-quarter revenue of $12.4 million, up from $6.1 million in the year-ago period. That's an impressive growth spurt, but still a very slim revenue stream. At the same time, the company faces massive expenses to keep the lights on and move its quantum research projects forward. IonQ's net loss in the third quarter was a staggering $54.5 million, up from $44.8 million. The company also reported negative <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/terms/f/free-cash-flow/\">free cash flows</a> of $83.7 million over the past three quarters. IonQ finances its operations by digging into a $336 million stash of short-term investments.</p><p>The company can probably stay in business for a few years on that basis, and a couple of more by asking shareholders for more cash through open-market stock sales. Still, this is clearly an expensive business to run, and IonQ investors are making a big bet on the company's ability to deliver game-changing quantum computing systems someday.</p><p>I could do a similar rundown of the other three companies, but it wouldn't be fun to read. For example, Quantum Computing measures its quarterly revenue in thousands of dollars rather than millions, but it still faces million-dollar operating expenses. You get the drift.</p><h2>Best quantum stock to buy on the January dip? Try Nvidia.</h2><p>One or more of these four quantum computing specialists might indeed stay relevant, successful, and solvent until their products can beat old-school digital computers in meaningful ways. IonQ is probably the safest bet, given its significantly larger scale and its ability to deliver a few experimental systems already.</p><p>But these technology specialists must compete against firmly established tech giants with much larger budgets. It was Google Quantum AI that delivered a promising error-correction breakthrough, not IonQ or Rigetti Computing.

      "thumbnailDesc": "Quantum computing stocks skyrocketed at the end of 2024. Pure-play stocks in this corner of the tech sector saw absolutely stellar price gains from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31. But the explosive returns turned into a rout in January:Quantum Computing StockNovember-December 2024 Price GainJan 2025 Price DropPrice Change From Oct. 31 to Jan. 31IonQ (IONQ -9.50%)178%(3%)167%Rigetti Computing (RGTI 4.03%)1,060%(10%)939%D-Wave Quantum (QBTS -6.61%)693%(28%)467%Quantum Computing (QUBT -7.76%)1,380%(35%)864%Data source: YCharts.These stocks have billion-dollar market caps today. Three months ago, only IonQ could make that claim. Market values ranged from $107 million for Quantum Computing to $253 million for Rigetti three months ago.Are these hungry upstarts too hot to touch, or are they simply great investments after January's price correction?Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's reality checkThe recent price drops stemmed an important statement from Nvidia (NVDA -5.74%) CEO Jensen Huang.Under the main-stage lights of the CES technology conference, Huang said that quantum computers are a long way away from being useful in any real-world application.\"If you kind of said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,\" Huang said. \"If you said 30, it's probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.\"That calm observation doused the hot gains of quantum computing stocks like a bucket of ice-cold water. Based on a recent technology breakthrough by Alphabet's (GOOG -0.45%) (GOOGL -0.39%) Google Quantum AI group, many investors expected quantum computing to become a useful technology very soon. Stretching that timeline from a couple of years to a couple of decades isn't quite as rewarding in the short term.The struggle is real and the road is longWith Huang's note in mind, you can't expect companies like IonQ or D-Wave to become cash-gushing industry giants anytime soon. Instead, the companies must find a way to develop money-making systems and services before running out of cash. That won't be easy in most cases.Sector leader IonQ saw third-quarter revenue of $12.4 million, up from $6.1 million in the year-ago period. That's an impressive growth spurt, but still a very slim revenue stream. At the same time, the company faces massive expenses to keep the lights on and move its quantum research projects forward. IonQ's net loss in the third quarter was a staggering $54.5 million, up from $44.8 million. The company also reported negative free cash flows of $83.7 million over the past three quarters. IonQ finances its operations by digging into a $336 million stash of short-term investments.The company can probably stay in business for a few years on that basis, and a couple of more by asking shareholders for more cash through open-market stock sales. Still, this is clearly an expensive business to run, and IonQ investors are making a big bet on the company's ability to deliver game-changing quantum computing systems someday.I could do a similar rundown of the other three companies, but it wouldn't be fun to read. For example, Quantum Computing measures its quarterly revenue in thousands of dollars rather than millions, but it still faces million-dollar operating expenses. You get the drift.Best quantum stock to buy on the January dip? Try Nvidia.One or more of these four quantum computing specialists might indeed stay relevant, successful, and solvent until their products can beat old-school digital computers in meaningful ways. IonQ is probably the safest bet, given its significantly larger scale and its ability to deliver a few experimental systems already.But these technology specialists must compete against firmly established tech giants with much larger budgets. It was Google Quantum AI that delivered a promising error-correction breakthrough, not IonQ or Rigetti Computing. Other heavyweights include IBM (IBM -1.06%) and Microsoft (MSFT -1.03%), and Huang's comments carry weight because Nvidia also runs a quantum computing research lab.So if you want to make an opportunistic investment in quantum computing right now, you should probably look at Nvidia's 18.6% price drop in January. That setback had nothing to do with quantum technology, but with the appearance of ultra-efficient artificial intelligence (AI) tools from DeepSeek.But a discount is a discount, and Nvidia will probably make a bigger splash in the quantum computing industry than Rigetti, D-Wave, IonQ, and Quantum Computing combined. I don't recommend anything more than a speculative little investment in any of the pure quantum computing names in 2025.",

According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Rigetti lost 14%, D-Wave Quantum was down 29%, and Quantum Computing had given up 37%.As you can see from the chart below, those three stocks all fell sharply during the week of the CES conference as the comments mentioned above come out.RGTI data by YChartsQuantum stocks hit a wallInvestors should understand that these three quantum computing companies are very much in the development stage, and have minimal revenue right now.Right now, the industry is moving in unison as investors see all three of these stocks as a way to get exposure to quantum computing and right now aren't differentiating much between them.The challenges last month started when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at CES that quantum computing was further away than investors had hoped, saying 15 to 30 years was a reasonable range for \"very useful quantum computers\" and that 20 years seemed like the consensus estimate. The stocks plunged on Jan. 8 as that news came out, and fell again on similar comments from Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg the following Monday as Zuckerberg said his understanding of quantum computing was that it was a \"decade-plus out.\" The sector then swung back the following day after D-Wave Quantum CEO Alan Baratz said he \"strongly disagreed\" with Huang's assertion and noted that there are different approaches to quantum. The following day, D-Wave Quantum said it had formed a new distribution partnership with Carahsoft Technology and Quantum Computing said it would collaborate with Sanders TDI, a biotech research institute, to research computational biomedicine. Both items show that interest seems to be building in quantum computing.On Jan. 16, short-seller Capybara Research announced a short position in Quantum Computing, calling it a \"rampant fraud\" and alleging that it faked sales and partnerships. The stocks rose toward the end of the month as D-Wave Quantum announced its new Leap Quantum LaunchPad program, which is designed to speed up the deployment of quantum computing applications. Finally, the sector also got some good news to close out the month from Needham, which raised its price targets on D-Wave Quantum to $8.50 and to $17 on Rigetti Computing and maintained a buy rating on both stocks. Needham cited a number of factors indicating momentum building in the quantum computing sector.

Over the last four quarters, Rigetti has brought in $11.9 million in revenue while D-Wave Quantum has generated $9.4 million in revenue. Quantum Computing, on the other hand, has made just $386,000 in revenue. All three stocks are also losing money and now trade at sky-high valuations following the boom in quantum computing in December. The price-to-sales ratios for all three are above 100, and they all have market caps above $1 billion despite generating minimal revenue.Clearly, investors have high expectations for the sector, but according to current results, these quantum computing stocks still aren't generating significant revenue and aren't growing particularly fast.While the sector does have disruptive potential, at this point a wait-and-see approach looks sensible given the lofty valuations and little in the way of fundamentals to back them up.",

Failed research ideas could bankrupt a smaller name, but IBM and Alphabet investors will barely notice them as a rounding error on financial statements.And let me just highlight their leading roles in this industry again. Rigetti, IonQ, and D-Wave have filed for a total of 396 quantum computing patents in the last 14 years. Google has them all beat with 428 filings over the same period, and IBM is the global leader with 630 patents.So, I'm more than happy to trust my nest egg with proven industry leaders who are also positioned to benefit from the incoming quantum computing boom someday. Big Blue and Google are two of my favorite long-term investment options anyway, and the quantum theory opportunity only adds to their value.",

The design of next generation annealers must facilitate the embedding of problems of practical relevance.\"It's been 10 years, and D-Wave still generates almost no revenue from its quantum computers. The company produced revenue of just $6.5 million through the first nine months of 2024, a strong indication that its technology just isn't all that useful.D-Wave is valued at more than $800 million. The company takes a different approach to quantum computing than its peers, but it still could be many years or decades before its quantum computers are useful enough to generate meaningful revenue and profit.Avoid the hypeQuantum computing is an exciting technology, but it's a field that has progressed slowly for decades. There are no guarantees that quantum computers will ever be able to solve useful real-world problems faster than traditional supercomputers. If they do, it could be decades down the road.The research that IonQ and D-Wave are doing is important to move quantum computing forward, but as investments, both stocks are incredibly risky.",

      "thumbnailDesc": "Quantum computing stocks have emerged as one of 2024's hottest investment themes, with the Defiance Quantum ETF (QTUM -2.90%) soaring 49.4% year to date, nearly doubling the S&P 500's robust 24.3% gain. While widespread commercial quantum computers might take years to develop, major technological breakthroughs have sparked an early rush into what many see as the next computing revolution.The excitement isn't just speculative hype. Quantum computing achieved two groundbreaking milestones in 2024, suggesting we're approaching a technological tipping point.Image source: Getty Images.Alphabet (GOOG -0.45%) (GOOGL -0.39%) made history with its Willow quantum computing system, which demonstrated the ability to reduce errors as the number of qubits increases exponentially. This breakthrough solves a challenge that has stumped researchers for nearly 30 years. Even more impressively, Willow completed a benchmark computation in under five minutes that would require today's fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years to solve -- a timespan far greater than the universe's age.Meanwhile, quantum computing start-up Infleqtion, working with Nvidia (NVDA -5.74%), achieved another first by demonstrating a practical materials science application using logical qubits. This breakthrough, which delivered a 6x boost in computational accuracy, hints at quantum computing's potential to revolutionize everything from battery technology to superconductors.While quantum computing remains in its infancy, these early breakthroughs, spurred by tech giants Alphabet and Nvidia, suggest we might be at the dawn of a computing revolution. Two companies are pioneering this transformative technology that could supercharge your portfolio in 2025 and beyond.Industry leadership through quantum executionTrapped-ion quantum computing leader IonQ (IONQ -9.50%) has emerged as one of 2024's standout quantum computing stocks. The company's novel approach uses ionized atoms as the heart of its quantum systems, enabling longer and more sophisticated calculations with fewer errors than competing approaches. IonQ's platform integrates with all major cloud providers and supports multiple programming languages, making quantum computing highly accessible to developers and researchers.The company's competitive advantages come from deep academic roots in ion trap technology spanning over 25 years of research and proven commercial traction through government and enterprise partnerships. IonQ has also expanded into quantum networking, working at the intersection of quantum computing and the future quantum internet.However, despite IonQ's impressive 258.5% stock gain in 2024, the company remains unprofitable and faces significant technological and commercialization risks. The quantum computing industry is still in its early stages, with uncertain timelines for achieving practical advantages over classical computers. Competition from tech giants and other quantum start-ups and the potential for technological obsolescence represent key risks to IonQ's market position.While IonQ's valuation may seem steep after its stellar 2024 run, with shares trading at nearly 250 times trailing sales, the company's growing commercial momentum, expanding quantum networking business, and strong balance sheet of $382.8 million at the end of the most recent quarter put it in pole position to capture a significant share of what could become a multitrillion-dollar quantum computing market. For investors with a high risk tolerance and a long-term horizon, IonQ offers pure-play exposure to one of technology's most promising frontiers.Industry leadership through superconducting innovationQuantum computing pioneer Rigetti Computing (RGTI 4.03%) takes a fundamentally different approach to quantum computing than IonQ, using superconducting circuits instead of trapped ions.

For those companies, $12 million in revenue is like a rounding error.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">At any rate, IonQ's quarterly revenue did increase by 104% year over year, so the company is growing quickly. However, potential investors shouldn't overlook how small its sales are </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">when</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> compared to other <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/terms/p/publicly-traded-companies/\">public companies</a>.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Turning to profitability, IonQ reported a net loss of $52.5 million; </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">the company's</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> quarterly losses amounted to roughly 4x </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">its</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> sales. As for its balance sheet, IonQ has about $365 million in cash </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">on hand</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> and only $18 million in debt. That's reassuring, as the company's <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/terms/f/free-cash-flow/\">free cash flow</a> is negative. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Over the last 12 months, it has a <em>negative</em> operating cash flow of about</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">$92 million.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">None of this is to say that IonQ's fundamentals are unexpected. As a cutting-edge company trying to develop a breakthrough technology, IonQ is spending heavily on research and development.

As of this writing, shares of IonQ are up more than 275% over the past 12 months.Needless to say, this high-flying quantum computing stock isn't for everyone. Like many companies in the field, IonQ doesn't have rock-solid fundamentals, as it is still in the very early stages of its business life cycle. Right now, the company is focused on research and development (R&D), and its financial results reflect that status.In its most recent quarter (ended Sept. 30, 2024), the company reported only $12.4 million in revenue. Bear in mind, I say 'only' because many public companies report well over $1 billion in revenue each quarter. For those companies, $12 million in revenue is like a rounding error.At any rate, IonQ's quarterly revenue did increase by 104% year over year, so the company is growing quickly. However, potential investors shouldn't overlook how small its sales are when compared to other public companies.Turning to profitability, IonQ reported a net loss of $52.5 million; the company's quarterly losses amounted to roughly 4x its sales. As for its balance sheet, IonQ has about $365 million in cash on hand and only $18 million in debt. That's reassuring, as the company's free cash flow is negative. Over the last 12 months, it has a negative operating cash flow of about $92 million.None of this is to say that IonQ's fundamentals are unexpected. As a cutting-edge company trying to develop a breakthrough technology, IonQ is spending heavily on research and development. Over the last 12 months, the company has poured roughly $30 million each quarter into R&D -- logically prioritizing that above all else.However, potential investors should understand there are risks to the company's strategy -- and owning its stock. If IonQ's research pays off. and the company announces key improvements to quantum computing technology, shareholders could be handsomely rewarded. If not, there is little to prevent IonQ shares from tumbling from their current highs. In other words, IonQ stock isn't for every investor or portfolio.AlphabetThen there's Alphabet (GOOG -0.45%) (GOOGL -0.39%).In some ways, the Google parent is responsible for kicking off the quantum computing rally. In early December 2024, Google announced that its Willow quantum computing chip had performed a complex computation in five minutes. The catch? It would take a present-day supercomputer 10 septillion years (yes, that is a real number) to perform the same calculation.Obviously, this was a big deal, and hopes soared that practical quantum computing could be much closer than anyone expected. However, there are still major hurdles to overcome when it comes to quantum computing.For one thing, quantum computers are notoriously error-prone. Because of their design, quantum bits, or qubits, are often unstable. Indeed, chips like Google's Willow must be kept extremely cold -- near absolute zero -- to function properly.Moreover, while Willow's problem-solving feat was impressive, some scientists believe we remain years -- if not decades away -- from practical quantum computers that can be put to use in fields like medicine or engineering.In short, quantum computing remains an experimental field for Alphabet. However, that might present an opportunity for investors who would like to have a stake in the quantum computing revolution but also want a more robust business model.Alphabet is a mature company, which generated about $340 billion in revenue over the last 12 months and $94 billion in net income over the same period. It has multiple revenue streams ranging from search to cloud computing to video streaming.In other words, not all of Alphabet's egg are in the quantum computing basket. Nevertheless, if the company does make a breakthrough within the field, an entirely new revenue stream could be unleashed that would make Alphabet all the more appealing to investors. And that makes Alphabet a compelling quantum computing stock to watch in 2025 -- and beyond.",

Sales for IonQ are on pace to have nearly doubled in 2024, with the consensus forecast for 2025 calling for 100% revenue growth.Meanwhile, Rigetti Computing develops quantum computing systems, superconducting quantum processors, and offers various professional services to its clients, which includes quantum application programming.Even though both companies offer seemingly sustained double-digit sales growth potential in what looks to be the hottest trend of 2025, not all Wall Street analysts believe the immediate future for quantum computing stocks is all that bright.According to price targets set by Needham analyst Quinn Bolton, IonQ is headed to $18 per share, while Rigetti Computing will pull back to $2 per share. If these price targets prove accurate, IonQ would decline by 54% from where it closed on Jan. 17, with the smaller Rigetti plunging by an even more jaw-dropping 80%!Although the excitement is palpable for quantum computing stocks, there are reasons to believe these parabolic moves in IonQ and Rigetti aren't sustainable.The parabolic move higher in quantum computing stocks will face multiple headwindsThe most obvious of all concerns is that history has a flawless track record when it comes to next-big-thing investments. Since the advent of the internet three decades ago, investors have consistently overestimated how quickly a new technology will be adopted by consumers and/or businesses and gain mainstream utility. This leads to lofty expectations not being met, which ultimately results in the bursting of a bubble.No matter how large the addressable market, not a single next-big-thing trend, technology, or innovation has escaped an early stage bubble-bursting event for 30 years. Quantum computing still has a long way to go before it's a mature technology.To build on this point, quantum computing hasn't yet demonstrated that it can be scaled. Though IonQ is pacing close to a quadrupling in sales from 2023 through 2025, it's only going to generate an estimated $83.5 million in revenue this year. Even with steady double-digit sales growth, these are nascent businesses working from a narrow base.Additionally, IonQ and Rigetti haven't shown that their operating models are sustainable. While it's easy for investors to be enamored with the largest and most-visible quantum computing stocks on Wall Street, it's important not to overlook their ongoing net losses and cash burn.IonQ has lost $129.7 million through the first nine months of 2024, with the company's operations burning through $66.3 million in cash. Similarly, Rigetti Computing has lost $48 million through the first three quarters of 2024, with cash burn from its operations expanding to $42.1 million from $38.2 million during the comparable period of the prior year.Like the metaverse, this is a technology that's going to require plenty of time and ample infrastructure to mature. This makes it likely Bolton's low-water price targets are hit sooner, rather than later.",

Clients who can't justify buying a dedicated AI server filled with high-end AI accelerators turn to cloud computing providers to rent some of their capabilities. This allows them to scale up or down the computing power they need, allowing them to be flexible. Because Google Cloud has a massive audience base, that computing power is then put to use by another client.This industry is a win-win for everyone involved, which is why the cloud computing market is expected to be worth more than $2 trillion by 2030. Google Cloud provides its clients with the best computing power available and was one of the first to get Nvidia's generation Blackwell GPUs up and running. Business is so good in the cloud computing realm that Alphabet has started construction on 11 new data center sites. With cloud revenue increasing 30% year over year to $12 billion in Q4, it's clear that all of this spending is benefiting Alphabet significantly. This is one of the biggest ways Alphabet can benefit from AI, but it's also integrating its AI tools into its legacy search business alongside the advertising tools that its clients have access to. Alphabet is set to be a big winner in the AI space, even if it isn't leading the generative AI arms race. Throw in the upside of quantum computing, and the narrative behind Alphabet's stock looks promising.GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsHowever, the market doesn't value Alphabet the same way, and the stock trades for an attractive 21 times forward earnings. Considering the upside Alphabet has from its various growth sectors, this seems like a no-brainer price to pay for the stock. It is a great one to stash away as the AI arms race and quantum computing races unfold.",

In glass batteries, electrolytes have a higher energy density and can deliver an equal amount of power as lithium-ion batteries but in a smaller space.</p><p data-block-key=\"3i3nh\">Quantum glass batteries also don't catch fire, so they don't need the components that lithium-ion batteries have to prevent them from doing so. Quantum glass batteries charge faster, too, and their higher energy density means they can give EVs greater range.</p><p data-block-key=\"btu2o\">Glass batteries are still a nascent technology, but you can see why this market would be alluring to investors, especially given the explosion in <a href=\"/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/consumer-discretionary/automotive-stocks/electric-car-stocks/\">demand for EVs</a> over the past few years and the general belief that EVs will eventually displace gas-powered vehicles.</p><p data-block-key=\"andar\">Below, we'll explore some of the companies that hold critical patents in quantum glass batteries.

      "thumbnailDesc": "Most investors probably aren't familiar with quantum glass batteries, but the technology could revolutionize electric vehicles (EVs) and the broader renewable energy industry. If you're wondering what a quantum glass battery is, a brief explanation follows. Image source: Getty Images. What are they?What are quantum glass batteries?Quantum glass batteries, or glass batteries, offer more advanced technology than the lithium-ion batteries common in today's EVs. In glass batteries, electrolytes have a higher energy density and can deliver an equal amount of power as lithium-ion batteries but in a smaller space.Quantum glass batteries also don't catch fire, so they don't need the components that lithium-ion batteries have to prevent them from doing so. Quantum glass batteries charge faster, too, and their higher energy density means they can give EVs greater range.Glass batteries are still a nascent technology, but you can see why this market would be alluring to investors, especially given the explosion in demand for EVs over the past few years and the general belief that EVs will eventually displace gas-powered vehicles.Below, we'll explore some of the companies that hold critical patents in quantum glass batteries. Keep reading to learn more about three of the best quantum glass battery technology companies today. Best stocks in 2024Best quantum glass battery stocks in 2024 Data source: Yahoo! Finance.

There's no reason to worry about the glass battery investments sinking the stock, meaning it will be less volatile than a pure-play battery stock. Toyota also plans to initially use its solid-state battery cells in its hybrid vehicles.In September 2022, the company acknowledged that it would take longer than expected to develop glass batteries for fully electric cars. Investors should expect such setbacks since producing these batteries at scale is a monumental engineering challenge.At its June 2023 shareholders meeting, the company touted a \"technological breakthrough\" in its solid-state batteries and now aims to sell them by 2027-28, pushing back an earlier target date of 2025. It expects to focus on both hybrids rather than EVs since the company sees hybrids as a good technological test case.It said its first solid-state battery would offer a 20% increase in range over its standard lithium-ion battery to more than 600 miles and a fast charging time of 10 minutes or less. 3. Solid Power3. Solid Power Solid Power is another glass battery stock that went public through a SPAC. Unlike QuantumScape, which is focused on making a complete battery, Solid Power's initial aim is to make only the solid electrolyte component. The component would replace the liquid electrolyte that is part of lithium-ion batteries, which will help give them more range and decrease pack size.Over the long term, the company plans to make its solid electrolyte more adaptable by removing nickel and cobalt from the cathode, which will help lower costs. Solid Power is now earning minimal revenue, bringing in $5.1 million in the second quarter of 2023.The company had $358.8 million in total liquidity as of June 30, 2024, and has been developing its technology since its 2012 founding. The company has an impressive list of high-profile investors, including carmakers such as Ford (F -0.41%), Hyundai (HYMTF 2.04%), and BMW (BAMXF 0.48%), as well as electronics giant Samsung (SSNL.F -28.79%).Solid Power aims to begin producing automotive-scale battery cells in 2025 with partners like Ford, BMW, and SK On. Still, the company's market cap of $257.7 million indicates investors are less convinced by Solid Power's technology than QuantumScape's, valued at roughly $2.9 billion.

Are they right for you?Are quantum glass battery stocks right for you?Investing in quantum glass battery stocks at this point is not much different from buying development-stage biotech stocks. We are still several years away from this technology going mainstream, and the field is wide open with no viable products available yet.Additionally, promises of technology haven't always come true in the auto industry. Many industry insiders, including auto company CEOs, expected autonomous vehicles to be commonplace by now, but that hasn't happened.That doesn't mean quantum batteries won't be successful, but investors may want to wait until more conclusive data comes in and a clear leader emerges. At this point, glass battery stocks are only suitable for investors with a very high tolerance for risk. Jeremy Bowman has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

IonQ reported better revenue than that -- $11.7 million -- but its losses were a staggering $0.93 per share. </p><h2>IonQ's big Q4 loss</h2><p>IonQ did its best to make bad results look good, emphasizing its $43.1 million in 2024 revenue (95% revenue growth), and noting Q4 revenue exceeded guidance (and was up 92% year over year). </p><p>IonQ also noted full-year bookings of twice its reported revenue at $95.6 million, implying strong sales growth will continue. Management forecast 2025 sales at between $75 million and $95 million, so $85 million at the midpoint, which is more than analysts anticipated. However, <em>sequential</em> sales growth looks to be negative, with IonQ warning that its Q1 2025 sales will be only $7 million or $8 million.</p><h2>IonQ's big cash grab</h2><p>And then, of course, there's the loss.

      "thumbnailDesc": "Shares of quantum computing systems provider IonQ (IONQ -9.50%) tumbled 11% through 11 a.m. ET Thursday after the company reported a big earnings miss for Q4 last night.Heading into the report, analysts forecast IonQ would lose $0.12 per share on $10.3 million in revenue. IonQ reported better revenue than that -- $11.7 million -- but its losses were a staggering $0.93 per share. IonQ's big Q4 lossIonQ did its best to make bad results look good, emphasizing its $43.1 million in 2024 revenue (95% revenue growth), and noting Q4 revenue exceeded guidance (and was up 92% year over year). IonQ also noted full-year bookings of twice its reported revenue at $95.6 million, implying strong sales growth will continue. Management forecast 2025 sales at between $75 million and $95 million, so $85 million at the midpoint, which is more than analysts anticipated. However, sequential sales growth looks to be negative, with IonQ warning that its Q1 2025 sales will be only $7 million or $8 million.IonQ's big cash grabAnd then, of course, there's the loss. IonQ's $0.93-per-share loss in Q4 and its full-year loss of $1.56 per share were both worse than investors had anticipated and are probably driving today's decline.Not helping with that is the fact that IonQ announced plans to raise another $500 million to fund its continuing losses.

Additionally, tech stocks fell broadly today in what seemed to be risk-off behavior, as bets on Federal Reserve rate cuts this year declined after a strong jobs report last Friday. That movement also likely weighed on quantum stocks, as all three companies are unprofitable and have minimal revenue.</p><p>As of 11:16 a.m. ET, D-Wave Quantum was down 31.4%, Quantum Computing 24.7%, and Rigetti Computing had lost 25.5%.</p><div class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Electrons circling around digital microchip.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F803809%2Fquantum-computing.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=700\" srcset=\"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A//g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/803809/quantum-computing.jpg&amp;w=300&amp;op=resize 300w, https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A//g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/803809/quantum-computing.jpg&amp;w=1000&amp;op=resize 1000w, https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A//g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/803809/quantum-computing.jpg&amp;w=2000&amp;op=resize 2000w\"><p class=\"caption\">Image source: Getty Images.</p></div><h2>Quantum hopes fade</h2><p>In an interview with Rogan, Zuckerberg said in response to a question on quantum computing: \"My understanding is that's still quite a ways off from being a very useful paradigm. I think Google just had some breakthrough, but I think most people still think that's like a decade-plus out, so my guess is that we're going to have pretty smart AIs even before that.\" </p><p>Like Huang last week, Zuckerberg is also throwing cold water on the idea that quantum computing is about to revolutionize the tech industry, in spite of <strong>Alphabet</strong>'s recent research milestone.</p><p>D-Wave Quantum also reported some news of its own last Friday, filing for a stock sale plan that allows it to sell up to $150 million in stock. Investors tend to dislike secondary offerings, as they dilute existing shareholders, but raising cash when the stock price is elevated makes sense, especially for a development-stage company like D-Wave. </p><div data-pitch-placement=\"in_line_article_pitch\"></div><p>Also on Friday, D-Wave announced that fiscal 2024 bookings would top $23 million, up 120% from fiscal 2023 levels, and Q4 bookings would be at least $18 million, up 500% from the quarter a year ago.  CEO Alan Baratz also pushed back on Huang's narrative on CNBC, saying that there are different kinds of quantum computing solutions, and some are maturing faster than others. He also said D-Wave's annealing quantum computing solutions are currently available and solving real problems. </p><p>Quantum Computing didn't have any news of its own to report, but the company is even smaller than D-Wave, with less than $1 million in revenue over the last four quarters.

      "thumbnailDesc": "Shares of quantum computing stocks like D-Wave Quantum (QBTS -6.61%), Quantum Computing (QUBT -7.76%), and Rigetti Computing (RGTI 4.03%) were tumbling again on Monday for the second time in just three sessions after Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg added his name to the growing chorus of skeptics on the new technology.Last Wednesday, quantum stocks plunged more than 40% after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at CES that quantum computing technology was 15 to 30 years away from being \"very useful.\"Zuckerberg appeared to express similar skepticism in an interview over the weekend with Joe Rogan. Additionally, tech stocks fell broadly today in what seemed to be risk-off behavior, as bets on Federal Reserve rate cuts this year declined after a strong jobs report last Friday. That movement also likely weighed on quantum stocks, as all three companies are unprofitable and have minimal revenue.As of 11:16 a.m. ET, D-Wave Quantum was down 31.4%, Quantum Computing 24.7%, and Rigetti Computing had lost 25.5%.Image source: Getty Images.Quantum hopes fadeIn an interview with Rogan, Zuckerberg said in response to a question on quantum computing: \"My understanding is that's still quite a ways off from being a very useful paradigm. I think Google just had some breakthrough, but I think most people still think that's like a decade-plus out, so my guess is that we're going to have pretty smart AIs even before that.\" Like Huang last week, Zuckerberg is also throwing cold water on the idea that quantum computing is about to revolutionize the tech industry, in spite of Alphabet's recent research milestone.D-Wave Quantum also reported some news of its own last Friday, filing for a stock sale plan that allows it to sell up to $150 million in stock. Investors tend to dislike secondary offerings, as they dilute existing shareholders, but raising cash when the stock price is elevated makes sense, especially for a development-stage company like D-Wave. Also on Friday, D-Wave announced that fiscal 2024 bookings would top $23 million, up 120% from fiscal 2023 levels, and Q4 bookings would be at least $18 million, up 500% from the quarter a year ago. CEO Alan Baratz also pushed back on Huang's narrative on CNBC, saying that there are different kinds of quantum computing solutions, and some are maturing faster than others. He also said D-Wave's annealing quantum computing solutions are currently available and solving real problems. Quantum Computing didn't have any news of its own to report, but the company is even smaller than D-Wave, with less than $1 million in revenue over the last four quarters. Its stock has soared even higher than D-Wave's over the last year, a disconnect that could lead to a continued decline in Quantum Computing's shares.Finally, Rigetti Computing is the biggest of these three stocks based on trailing revenue, with nearly $12 million over the last four quarters. Rigetti is likely to move with its peers, even if it is the largest of the three, as investor perceptions of the industry are still rapidly evolving. What's next for quantum computing stocks?These stocks still trade at a valuation of over $1 billion, which makes them very expensive for development-stage companies, and they could easily fall further. D-Wave's financial update last week was encouraging, but the stock still fell on the news, showing that the sector looks overvalued after last month's surge.Speculative investors could take a small position in D-Wave or its peers, but competition from Alphabet also means that success in quantum computing doesn't mean success for these stocks.

      "thumbnailDesc": "What goes up must come down. But what goes down can shoot right back up again -- especially when it receives a big boost from Microsoft (MSFT -1.03%).This is what's happening on Wednesday, as quantum computing investors cheer some kind words from Microsoft's strategic missions and technologies chief, Mitra Azizirad, who last night urged quantum investors to get ready, because \"we are right on the cusp of seeing quantum computers solve meaningful problems and capture new business value.\" Seconding that emotion, shares of Rigetti Computing (RGTI 4.03%) shares exploded 25.6% higher through 10:25 a.m. ET this morning. IonQ (IONQ -9.50%) is also joining in the fun, up 26.9%, while D-Wave Quantum (QBTS -6.61%) gained 31.1%. Best of all is Quantum Computing (QUBT -7.76%), which rose an astounding 44% in the first hour of trading on the Nasdaq.Volatility, thy name is quantumWhat a difference a week makes!It was only last week, if you recall, that quantum computing stocks collapsed under the weight of negative comments from Nvidia (NVDA -5.74%) CEO Jensen Huang, who warned that it will probably be 20 years before quantum computers exist that are capable of doing anything \"very useful\" for customers. Meta Platforms (META -4.35%) CEO Mark Zuckerberg quickly piled on with negative comments of his own, and in no time flat, quantum stocks were in free fall, losing 50% and more of their respective market capitalizations in less than a week. Now the quantum computing stock trade is reversing in a big way -- and no wonder. On her Microsoft blog last night, Azizirad declared 2025 \"the year to become Quantum-ready.\" The Microsoft exec says that \"the pace of quantum research and development is only going to accelerate [over] the next 12 months.\" And this means that -- whether or not it takes 20 years for quantum to become \"very useful\" to businesses -- from an investor's perspective, 2025 is going to be a year chock-full of positive PR over quantum's progress. That alone should be very good news for quantum computing stocks' prices, regardless of what happens on these stocks' bottom lines.Image source: Getty Images.Caveats and provisosBut the more quantum stocks' prices divorce themselves from the companies' underlying fundamentals, the more overpriced they will become -- and the riskier they will become to invest in.Consider: The four quantum stocks named above boast a combined market capitalization of some $12.6 billion after today's run-up. Not one of these companies is currently profitable, however. Indeed, if you add up all their revenues, the four of them combined generated less than $60 million in revenue over the last 12 months.Result: Quantum computing stocks in total sell for a staggering 210 times their minuscule revenues.Granted, some quantum stocks are worse than others. Quantum Computing, for example, may have been savvy enough to snag the phrase \"quantum computing\" for its name, but the $386,000 in revenue it accumulated over the last year means that, at nearly $1 billion in market cap, Quantum Computing stock sells for nearly 2,500 times sales.
